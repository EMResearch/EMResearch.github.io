<p class="main-summary">
    The AISE Lab at <a href="https://www.kristiania.no/">Kristiania University College</a> (Oslo, Norway)
    performs research in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in the field of Software Engineering (SE).
    Currently, one of our main research topics is the use of Evolutionary Algorithms (a sub-field of AI) to solve the
    SE problem of automatically generating test cases for web and enterprise applications.
</p>

<p class="main-text">
    One of the main goals of the group is to do research with practical value for SE practitioners.
    This means that not only we have collaborations with different industrial partners, but also all of the
    software outputs of our projects are released as open-source, with strong emphasis in developing
    usable tools (and not just throw-away proof-of-concepts).
    Our current flagship tool is called <b>EvoMaster</b> (<a href="https://www.evomaster.org">www.evomaster.org</a>).
